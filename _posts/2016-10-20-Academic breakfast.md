â€‹Dear colleagues,

To celebrate the beginning of the fall semester and welcome our new PhD students,  the GAME (Geneva Academics in Management and Economics) PhD students association is organizing an Academic Breakfast. We will all gather around a cup of coffee and some croissants on **Tuesday October 25th in room M5342 at 9.30 am**.
 
The Academic Breakfast has the aim of getting to know each other, sharing topics of research and discussing issues concerning the assistantship and the faculty. At this occasion, Emmanuel Milet, a post-doc in Economics at the GSEM, will share some useful tips on how to carry on research using Stata. You can download the slides of his presentation [here](game-unige-blog.github.io/files/GAME_presentation.pdf).

Feel free to share this information to your fellow PhD colleagues, and encourage them to send an email to game@unige.ch if they are not yet registered in the asssociation.

We are looking forward to see you all there.

Have a good week,


Your GAME committee
