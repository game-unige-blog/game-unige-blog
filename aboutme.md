Our association, *Geneva Academics in Management and Economics* (**GAME**) offers a platform to get in contact with other PhDs candidates, within GSEM and beyond, and provides support for organizing events of interest for our community.  GAME promotes disciplinary openness and excellence in research by fostering the communication and exchange between the different research institutes composing the GSEM. These institutes are:
 
-          Institute of Economics and Econometrics
-          Institute of Management
-          Geneva Finance Research Institute
-          Research Center for Statistics
-          Information Science Institute
 
In order to fulfill its purpose, GAME carries several activities and events. Some of our initiatives are:
 
·         The “**Academic Breakfast**”: it is one of the activities carried out regularly by the GAME association. On one hand, it allows GSEM PhD students and teaching assistants to get together in an informal way to discuss their doctoral projects as well as issues related to teaching charges and other administrative matters relevant to their academic life. On the other hand, the Academic Breakfast supports the exchange of knowledge between the different research fields of the faculty and encourages interdisciplinary work .
 
·         The “**e-Journal**”: GAME is launching its own journal. This electronic platform will provide a space where PhD candidates can share articles on their academic interests, as well as promote their personal research. Besides reinforcing the exchange of knowledge within the faculty, this website will allow to portray the research excellence of our PhD students.
 
·         The “**Social agenda**”: As nurturing and creating networks and collaborative exchanges are part of GAME’s agenda, social gatherings and films projections are also organized. Past events have succeeded to gather not only our PhD students, but a bigger share of Geneva’s PhD community.
 
Being a member of GAME is free and without obligations. You can simply enjoy our events; or if you wish, initiate and lead activities for our PhD community. To become a member, please send an email to [game@unige.ch](mailto:game@unige.ch) stating your wish to join our association.
